#+TITLE: scoop-cbilson

My custom scoop recipes...stuff that I may PR to scoop-extras or scoop
someday, if it even works...

* TODOs
  Here are some recipes I want to make before I setup my next window
  machine:

  - [ ] aspell
  - [ ] ack
  - [ ] conkeror
  - [ ] dotpeek
  - [ ] exploded sysinternals suite, as well as the whole suite.
  - [ ] fsharp, fsx
  - [ ] git-tfs
  - [ ] nemerle
  - [ ] graphviz, umlgraph
  - [ ] java, leiningen

* Ideas

** DotFiles
   I wish there were a way to define all the dotfiles I want in a JSON
   file or something like that, and say something like `scoop install
   mydotfiles` to get them all from github or wherever.
   - I guess this isn't a scoop problem per se, just something I want
     to do around the same time as using scoop to set up a machine.
   - I'd like this to work across platforms and allow me to
     update.
